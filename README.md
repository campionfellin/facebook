Working on my Facebook bot!


So far, this is what it does:

## 1.

  You may greet it with any of ["hi", "hello", "hey", "sup", "whats up", "what's up"]
  
  and it will respond with "Hi ___________" <-- being your nickname.
  If you don't yet have a nickname, it will say "Hi \<first_name\>" and ask you if you would like
  to change it to:
    
            1. first_name
            2. Mr. last_name
            3. Mrs. last_name
            
            
## 2

  At any time, you may say one of ["change my name", "new name", "new nickname", "change nickname"]
  
  and you will be able to change your nickname, given the same options above.
  

## 3

  You may also say one of ["go hawks", "sea", "seahawks"]
  
  and it will respond accordingly.
