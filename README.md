# facebook

Working on my Facebook bot!


So far, this is what it does:

## 1.

  You may greet it with any of ["hi", "hello", "hey", "sup", "whats up", "what's up"]
  
  and it will respond with "Hi ___________" <-- being your nickname.
  If you don't yet have a nickname, it will say "Hi \<first_name\>"
